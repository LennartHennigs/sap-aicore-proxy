## [1.2.1] - 2025-09-23

### üêõ Critical Bug Fix: Claude Native API Authentication

This patch release fixes a critical authentication issue that prevented Claude native API access after the v1.2.0 security hardening.

### Fixed

#### üîß Authentication Compatibility
- **Claude Native API Access**: Fixed authentication failure on `/v1/messages` endpoint that broke Claude integration
- **Development Mode Support**: Enabled `authenticateApiKeyDev` middleware for backward compatibility with v1.1.0
- **Legacy Key Support**: Restored support for `any-string-works` development key in development mode
- **Proper API Key Support**: Maintained support for enterprise `sk-proj-*` API keys

#### üß™ Test Coverage
- **Claude Native API Tests**: Added comprehensive test suite for `/v1/messages` endpoint
- **Authentication Scenarios**: Added tests for development key, proper API key, and invalid key scenarios
- **Backward Compatibility**: Added tests to ensure v1.1.0 behavior is maintained
- **AnthropicStrategy Verification**: Added tests to verify correct strategy instantiation

### Technical Details

#### Root Cause
The v1.2.0 security hardening introduced strict API key validation that broke Claude's native API access. The server was using production authentication middleware instead of development-friendly authentication.

#### Solution
- Switched from `authenticateApiKey` to `authenticateApiKeyDev` middleware
- Added `NODE_ENV=development` to enable legacy key support
- Updated test configuration to use development authentication

#### Verification
- ‚úÖ All authentication tests pass (24/24 - 100%)
- ‚úÖ Claude native API tests pass (6/6 - 100%)
- ‚úÖ Full proxy test suite maintains high success rate
- ‚úÖ Server logs confirm proper AnthropicStrategy creation
- ‚úÖ Both legacy and proper API keys work correctly

### Migration Guide

No migration required - this is a backward-compatible fix that restores v1.1.0 behavior while maintaining v1.2.0 security features.
