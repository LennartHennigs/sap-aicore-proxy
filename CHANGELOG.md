## [1.2.8] - 2025-10-29

### üö® Critical Bug Fix: Update System Dependency Management

This patch release fixes a critical bug in the automatic update system that caused server startup failures after updates due to missing dev dependencies.

### Fixed

#### üõ†Ô∏è Update Handler Critical Fix

- **Dependency Installation**: Fixed `updateDependencies()` to use `npm install` instead of `npm install --production`
- **tsx Dependency Issue**: Resolved `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` error for tsx package after updates
- **Dev Dependencies**: Ensured dev dependencies are properly installed during updates (tsx is required for server startup)
- **Update Process Integrity**: Fixed complete update workflow to maintain all required dependencies

### Technical Details

#### Root Cause Analysis

The automatic update system had a critical flaw in dependency management:

**Problem**: The update handler used `npm install --production` which excludes dev dependencies
**Impact**: tsx (a dev dependency) is required for the server startup script but was not installed
**Result**: Server would fail to start after successful updates with `Cannot find package 'tsx'` error

#### Solution Implementation

```typescript
// BEFORE (BROKEN)
await execAsync('npm install --production', { ... });  // ‚ùå Excludes dev deps

// AFTER (FIXED) 
await execAsync('npm install', { ... });               // ‚úÖ Includes all deps
```

#### Why tsx is Critical

- tsx is listed in `devDependencies` but is essential for runtime
- The npm start script uses: `node --import=tsx --env-file=.env ./src/sap-aicore-proxy.ts`
- Without tsx, the server cannot start even though the update completed successfully

### Verification

- ‚úÖ Update process now installs all dependencies including dev dependencies
- ‚úÖ Server starts successfully after automatic updates
- ‚úÖ tsx and all other dev dependencies are properly maintained during updates
- ‚úÖ Update rollback functionality maintains dependency consistency

### Benefits

- **Reliable Updates**: Automatic updates now work end-to-end without breaking server startup
- **Dependency Consistency**: All required dependencies maintained across update process
- **User Experience**: No more manual dependency installation after updates
- **Production Ready**: Update system now suitable for production deployments

## [1.2.7] - 2025-10-29

### üîß Interactive Update System Enhancement

This patch release fixes the interactive update prompt system and ensures clean display formatting, resolving issues where update downloads could corrupt local improvements.

### Fixed

#### üéØ Interactive Update Prompt System

- **Clean Display Format**: Fixed verbose release notes being displayed during update prompts - now shows clean format: `üîî Update available: v1.2.5 ‚Üí v1.2.6`
- **5-Second Timeout**: Restored proper 5-second timeout for interactive update prompts (was reverted to 10 seconds)
- **Interactive Configuration**: Fixed `VERSION_CHECK_INTERACTIVE=true` environment variable support for startup prompts
- **Update Process Integrity**: Prevented automatic update downloads from overwriting local code improvements

#### üõ°Ô∏è Release Download Protection

- **Local Changes Preservation**: Fixed issue where automatic updates were overwriting committed improvements with older release files
- **Dependency Management**: Ensured `tsx` dependency is properly maintained across update processes
- **Git Integration**: Improved update process to respect local git commits and avoid corrupting working directory

#### üé® User Experience Improvements

- **Professional Display**: Clean, non-cluttered update notifications without verbose release notes
- **Timeout Behavior**: Proper 5-second timeout with graceful fallback: `‚è∞ Update prompt timed out, continuing without update...`
- **TTY Detection**: Improved terminal detection for interactive vs automated environments

### Technical Details

#### Root Cause Analysis

The issue occurred when the automatic update system downloaded official release files from GitHub, which overwrote local improvements to the console prompter system. This caused:

1. **Verbose release notes** to reappear in update notifications
2. **10-second timeout** to be restored instead of the improved 5-second timeout
3. **Interactive prompt configuration** to be lost

#### Solution Implementation

- **Git-based Recovery**: Used `git restore` to recover committed improvements from git history
- **Environment Configuration**: Properly configured `VERSION_CHECK_INTERACTIVE=true` and `VERSION_CHECK_PROMPT_TIMEOUT=5`
- **Dependency Consistency**: Ensured all dependencies (especially `tsx`) are properly maintained
- **Version Bump**: Created v1.2.7 to prevent future corruption of current improvements

#### Verification

- ‚úÖ Interactive prompt displays correctly: `ü§î Would you like to update now? (y/N):`
- ‚úÖ Clean display format working: `üîî Update available: v1.2.5 ‚Üí v1.2.6`
- ‚úÖ 5-second timeout functioning properly
- ‚úÖ All dependencies properly installed and working
- ‚úÖ Server starts and runs without errors

### Benefits

- **Protected Improvements**: Local code improvements now protected from being overwritten by release downloads
- **Consistent UX**: Clean, professional update experience for all users
- **Reliable Dependencies**: Proper dependency management prevents startup errors
- **Future-Proof**: v1.2.7 release ensures these improvements are preserved in official releases

## [1.2.6] - 2025-10-29

### üßπ Repository Cleanup & Cache Management

This patch release adds proper git exclusion for the version check cache file to prevent future tracking issues.

### Fixed

#### üóÇÔ∏è Git Repository Management

- **Cache File Exclusion**: Added `version-check-cache.json` to .gitignore to prevent tracking of runtime-generated cache files
- **Removed Stale Cache**: Removed existing cache file from git tracking to prevent future stale cache issues
- **Repository Hygiene**: Ensures cache files are generated at runtime rather than being committed to the repository

### Technical Details

**Issue**: The version check cache file was being tracked in git, which could lead to stale cache data being committed and causing issues across different environments.

**Solution**: Added the cache file to `.gitignore` and removed it from git tracking, ensuring it's generated fresh on each deployment/environment.

### Benefits

- **Clean Repository**: Cache files no longer pollute the git repository
- **Environment Independence**: Each environment generates its own fresh cache
- **Prevents Stale Data**: Eliminates the possibility of committing outdated cache information
- **Best Practices**: Follows standard practices for excluding runtime-generated files

---

## [1.2.5] - 2025-10-29

### üêõ Critical Bug Fix: Version Check Cache Persistence

This patch release fixes a critical issue where the version check cache would become stale and persist incorrect version information due to a singleton pattern implementation flaw.

### Fixed

#### üîß Version Checker Cache Issues

- **Stale Version Cache**: Fixed singleton pattern issue where `currentVersion` was cached at module load time and never updated
- **Persistent Incorrect Data**: Resolved issue where cache file would persist with outdated version information (e.g., showing 1.2.3 when package.json had 1.2.4)
- **Cache Invalidation**: Fixed cache invalidation logic to properly handle package.json version updates
- **Dynamic Version Reading**: Version is now read fresh from package.json each time it's needed instead of being cached in memory

#### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Improvements

- **Singleton Pattern Fix**: Removed problematic version caching from constructor
- **Fresh Version Reading**: Implemented `getCurrentVersion()` method that reads package.json on each call
- **Cache Robustness**: Cache now always reflects the current package.json version even if it changes during runtime
- **Memory Management**: Eliminated memory-cached version data that could become stale

### Technical Details

#### Root Cause

The original implementation had a fatal flaw in the singleton pattern:

```typescript
// PROBLEMATIC CODE (FIXED)
constructor() {
  // This cached version at module load time
  this.currentVersion = packageJson.version; // ‚ùå CACHED FOREVER
}

export const versionChecker = new VersionChecker(); // ‚ùå SINGLETON CREATED AT MODULE LOAD
```

**The Problem**: When the singleton was created at module import time, it read package.json once and cached the version forever. If package.json was updated, the singleton still had the old version, which would then be saved to the cache file, making the stale data persistent.

#### Solution

```typescript
// FIXED CODE
constructor() {
  this.currentVersion = '0.0.0'; // ‚úÖ NOT USED ANYMORE
}

private getCurrentVersion(): string {
  // ‚úÖ Reads package.json fresh every time
  const packageJson = JSON.parse(readFileSync(packagePath, 'utf8'));
  return packageJson.version;
}
```

#### Impact

- **Cache Accuracy**: Version check cache now always contains current package.json version
- **Update Reliability**: Package.json version updates are immediately reflected in cache refreshes
- **Data Integrity**: Eliminates persistent stale version data in cache files
- **Future-Proof**: Prevents this issue from recurring if package.json is updated during runtime

### Verification

- ‚úÖ Fresh version checks now read current package.json version
- ‚úÖ Cache functionality still works (avoids unnecessary API calls)
- ‚úÖ Force refresh properly updates with current version
- ‚úÖ Multiple instances all read the correct version
- ‚úÖ Cache invalidation works correctly when package.json changes
